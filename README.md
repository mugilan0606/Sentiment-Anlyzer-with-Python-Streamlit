# Sentiment-Anlyzer-with-Python-Streamlit
Hey there! 
In this project i have created an application which can analyze the sentiments of a given text. 
The senitiment anlayzer provides three models by which one can analyze the sentiment. the models implemented are:
1) Count Vectorizer with Multinommial Naive beyes classifier
2) Count vectorizer with Logistic Regression
3) TF-IDF Vectorizer with Logistic regression. 

The model is created in google colab and was exported using the pickle Module. 

The Colab Links are:
1) Count Vectorizer with Multinommial Naive beyes classifier

NOTE: This repository doesn't include the exported pickle file, as the file size is too large to accomodate.

To implement the project,

i)Execute the google colab codes and export the pickle files.

ii)mport the pickle files to Sentiment/sentimentanalyzer folder.

iii)Then execute the command: streamlit run app.py

iv)Now,go to the given local host address.
